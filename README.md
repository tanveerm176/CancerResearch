### Abstract
Estrogens are steroid molecules that promote and regulate cell and tissue growth. This growth becomes an issue when cells malfunction as seen in cancerous outcomes. Xenoestrogens also bind to the estrogen receptor (ER) and serve as key ingredients in widespread products. Experimental assays demonstrate that many xenoestrogens bind weakly to the ER; however, it is often unknown as to whether these compounds mimic the magnitude of the estrogenâ€™s response. In our previous study, we used Autodock Vina to predict the binding affinity and poses of estradiol, triclosan and methylparaben in the ER binding pocket, which were in reasonable agreement with experiment. As a continuation of this work, we performed a large scale binding affinity survey of 171 xenoestrogens using Autodock Vina to assess the reliability of our computational predictions on a more diverse groups of ligands with different chemical function groups. The parabens produced the best results while the antiestrogens produced the worst results relative to experiment. Future work will focus on linking the chemical nature of these ligands to the accuracy of their computational models.
